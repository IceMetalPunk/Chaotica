##Chaotica: Use the magic of chaos to shape your world!
####A Mod for Minecraft 1.10.2

Chaotica is what I like to call a "magitech" mod: it's themed around magic, but it functions like tech.
In Chaotica, there isn't much in the way of electricity generation or Redstone Flux. Instead, you power your devices using liquid Chaos. Of course, chaos is, by definition, unpredictable, so virutally every device has chaotic risks associated with it, which can be mitigated through the use of upgrades called Chaotic Cores.

There are many blocks and items added by Chaotica, but the basic path is simple: create dissimilar blocks on opposite sides of a Chaotic Condenser, and it will produce raw, Corrosive Chaos. This can then be used to power other devices as you see fit. Corrosive Chaos is unfettered, though, so if you want safety, you'll have to make a Chaotic Purifier to convert it into Pure Chaos, which is slightly more efficient and infinitely safer.

A full list of the mod's additions, along with far more detail, will be available as development progresses, but you can check the To Do list in the comments of the main Chaotica.java file for information about what's planned (all plans are subject to change later, of course).

Good luck, my fellow Chaomancers; go create the world you've always wanted in your most chaotic dreams!
